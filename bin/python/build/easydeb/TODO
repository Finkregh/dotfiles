BUGS

* make python-pypi-* depend on python2.4-pipy-* (done)
* why is ${shlibs:Depends} missing for Arch any? (done)
* maintainer (getent passwd $USER) + config file (done)
* getting release numbers right. We do know, that we distribute packages, and when we update them, the version number must be higher. (done)

* So if you add a PKG-INFO file to PIL, with a  "Requires: Tk" line, it will add python2.4-tk as a depenency?
* and make sure, that you have a "common" database file, a distribution specific one, and a local one.
* if a package doesn't contain meta information, where do I store that? that's currently the think, how you use the -u option
* handling dependency information, either derived from the metainfo, or from the database(s). Use the databases, if dependency information is missing.

* write documentation ... the current documentation is _not_ well written. Explain the concepts that you do have in mind
* manual pages for you two scripts
* manual pages describing your database format (even if these are ascii files)
* documentation how a developer is supposed to work with your tool, look at our log, where I did ask questions, what to do next, maybe take that as a guide line.

* if I try to download something, which doesn't exist, then I get an exception, not an error message
* have a look at debootstrap an dchroot
* make that working for distributions as well (so that a version packaged for breezy get's a higher version number than one for hoary). keep it in mind, don't implement it now

* deps database finish
